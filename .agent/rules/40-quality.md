# Engineering Quality Rules

- TypeScript strict mode ON.
- Prefer small, reviewable commits.
- Every feature slice includes:
  - minimal tests
  - a short README update (what changed, how to run)
- Avoid over-engineering:
  - MVP first, extensible interfaces, but no premature abstractions.
- Keep dependencies minimal and well-justified.

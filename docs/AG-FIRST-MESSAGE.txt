We are building "World-Seed": an Electron desktop app for ultra-fast atomic idea capture + AI-assisted classification/linking/conflict detection.

Follow workspace rules under .agent/rules strictly:
- AI must output ChangeSet JSON only; never write directly.
- Provide a git-like review/apply UI with traceability to original notes.
- Vault is file-based and OneDrive-friendly.

Start with /bootstrap workflow. After it passes, propose the next smallest slice and run /vault. Keep commits small and runnable at every step.
